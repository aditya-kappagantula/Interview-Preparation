# Interview-Preparation
A list of questions that can be helpful in cracking technical interviews.
Some questions may look too naive. But from experience, I can say, they are just for practice.

Some standard examples of where one feels how come I forgot this!
1. Read an put from a large string. [Use BufferedReader/Scanner? But how? I forgot syntax. Last time I used it was long long ago.] What all methods are available in Scanner?

2. How to build a 2-D Matrix in Java? Forgot about 2Dimensional array creation and iteration

3. How to  create and iterate a Hashmap. How to get all keys?

4. What is the best way to build a board to solve board games like 8-queen problem, sudoku etc...

5. Tree addition, height, string reversal etc...
